# QAZ-Fold-Vial

This is a Vial firmware hex file for the QAZ Fold keyboard sold by Coffee Break Keyboards.
Due to space constraints, there are only 4 combo slots, and no support for mouse keys. If you want this let me know.

This follows the wiring diagram listed here: https://github.com/CoffeeBreakKeyboards/QAZ-Fold-Documentation/
My implementation looks like this https://imgur.com/gallery/qPbZHFs

Hope this gets yall up and running!
